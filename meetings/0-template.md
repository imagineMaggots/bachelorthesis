#### <div style="font-size: 1.5em; color: rgba(130,255,0,.87)">1 Organizing and Deadline-Checks / Setup
- Introduction (Topic)
- Consider: Deadlines (long-term scheduling) // Leave space for
- Consider: Meetings (short-term scheduling) // Leave space for
- manage organizational trouble
#### <div style="font-size: 1.5em; color: rgba(255,130,130,.87)">2 Current problems
- Talk about ToDo list(s)
- (Assignment of tasks --- if needed)<!--can be embarassing-->
- this is here in order for me to remember to include some summaries for myself in order to talk about my progress without being confused
- might be a summary of summaries... if a lot of progress has been made!
#### <div style="font-size: 1.5em; color: rgba(255,0,0,.87)">3 Discussion
- Mid-term scheduling 
* known "To Do's" can result in an overseeable needed time in order "To Do" them
* what "a To Do" is and how long it takes is variable and might vary in temporal lenght
* writing a proper "To Do" list can be the trickiest part, but once it can and has been done, everything else should flow nicely
* might need reiteration (next meeting)
#### <div style="font-size: 1.5em; color: rgba(255,255,0,.87)">4 Questions / Answers
- Prepared/Asked questions with room for answers
- Not all questions _need_ to be asked in meeting, but others will take notice, wether you've prepared questions or not
<!-- grandiose highlighting in markdown. this is a comment btw. this is how markdown introductory web-pages were created. possibly. somebody thought "hey this is neetly structured, others will think so as well"... kinda boring -->
#### <div style="font-size: 1.5em; color: rgba(130,130,255,.87)">3 Discussion / Later Comments
- Maybe some ToDo's seem a bit strange/off?
- Space to denote those-
- Additional space to review these first.
- needs variable page size, while everything else can be of predetermined length
#### <div style="font-size: 1.5em; color: rgba(130, 215, 255, 1)">5 Takeaways and ToDo's
- In meeting:
    - Usually: URLs or (ideally) mail-adresses.
    - Sometimes: PDF-files
    - Commonly: none
- Post meeting:
    - derived from the "later comments" in "discussion"...
