### <div style="font-size: 1.7em; color: white; background-color: black">Agenda for meeting</div>
1) <div style="font-size: 1.3em">Organizing and Deadline-Checks ("Setup" in the first meeting)
- "In between" presentation at the chair of information- and communication-services at the University of Rostock: 27.10.2025
- Deadline: 02.12.2025 (currently. extension considered)
- next meeting: 17th of october 2025, in person
- next progress: 16th of october 2025 7pm
2) <div style="font-size: 1.3em">Evaluating Current Progress 
- this is here in order for me to remember to include some summaries for myself in order to talk about my progress without being confused
- might be a summary of summaries...
3) <div style="font-size: 1.3em">Discussion with room for comments later
- Subtitle "Technologien" unclear, Prof. prefers "Stand der Technik"... which i am fine with, as long as it isn't "State of the Art"
- Subtitle "Tests" below "Existierende Ansätze"
- Subtitle "Ungelöst" into "Eigene Beiträge" or similar
- First sentence
    - move into pdfcomment
    - can be "The first sentence" (literally, if you want/need to review the first sentence intensively (which makes sense, if you think about the people reading, not yourself writing))
    - the first pdfcomment of my thesis is going to say "Der erste Satz"
- Introduction closes in on the topic too quick
    - smoothen the entering sentences
    - examples are to specific
    - remember "classical" translation (non-machine based, humanly)
- tabular structure of listed examples isn't easily understandable
    - examples were okay though
- "\section{example}" can produce 4 Permutations when; translating "section", while keeping "example"; translating "section", as well as "example"; keeping "section", translating "example"; keeping "section", as well as "example";
4) <div style="font-size: 1.3em">Questions / Answers for the next meeting
- i don't really see how the 4 permutations are going to be relevant as of now (14.10.2025)
5) <div style="font-size: 1.3em">Takeaways and ToDos (new deadlines)
