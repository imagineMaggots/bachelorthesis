    - edit of titles
    - consider format of examples
    - expand examples
- change structure of examples (tabular)

### expanded tasks
- edit general structure (see meeting from 14th of october 2025)
- edit introduction (see meeting from 14th of october 2025)
    - see examples in "introduction"
    - work on 
- edit list of exemplary problems (see meeting from 14th of october 2025)
    - start with edits of titles
        - proposed change: "Problemfälle/Technische Bedeutung" into "Problemfälle/Befehls-Verfälschung" // Kapiteltitel hoffentlich nicht zu kompliziert
        - proposed change: "Problemfälle/Sprachliche Semantik" into "Problemfälle/Nicht-verbale Kontexte" // meint: Kontext geht aus Formeln, Tabellen... implizit hervor
        - proposed change: "Problemfälle/Spezifischer Technologien" into "Problemfälle/Graphische (Layouting)" // Klammern unschön
        - proposed change: "Problemfälle/Weitere Schwierigkeiten" into "Problemfälle/Sprachliche" // an sich geht aus "Weitere Schwierigkeiten" genug hervor...
    - consider format of examples
    - expand examples
- change structure of examples (tabular)
- edit structure of "current technological standards" and "own contribution"

### Issues
- none as of now

### summary of progress so far
- structure of document
    - introduction, examples (of problems), current technological standards, contribution, conclusion
- introduction
    - Introduction has been layed out, but needs updates.
    - has "unnecessaties" (meaning: information, that isn't needed)
    - is "overcomplicating" (meaning: provided examples do not "catch" a broader audience)
    - too long (textually), but too brief (contextually)
- problem (examples)
    - List of examplary problems has been partially layed out.
- current technological standards
    - structure has been proposed
- own contribution
    - structure has been (kinda) approved (unintentionally)
    - needs updates
- conclusion
