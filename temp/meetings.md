- Mainly organizational trouble
- Talk about ToDo list(s)
- (Assignment of tasks --- in groups)
- Mid-term scheduling 
    * known "To Do's" can result in an overseeable needed time in order "To Do" them
    * what "a To Do" is and how long it takes is variable and might vary in temporal lenght
    * writing a proper "To Do" list can be the trickiest part, but once it can and has been done, everything else should flow nicely
    * might need reiteration (next meeting)
