- introduction
    - Introduction has been layed out, but needs updates.
    - has "unnecessaties" (meaning: information, that isn't needed)
    - is "overcomplicating" (meaning: provided examples do not "catch" a broader audience)
    - too long (textually), but too brief (contextually)
- problem (examples)
    - List of examplary problems has been partially layed out.
- current technological standards
    - structure has been proposed
- own contribution
    - structure has been (kinda) approved (unintentionally)
    - needs updates
- conclusion
