- introduce the reader into topic (see: ~/thesis/introduction)
- think of the problems that could arise when translating LaTeX formatted documents (see: ~/examples and ~/thesis/problems)
- determine the current technologies, which could tackle these problems (see ~/tests)
    - list these in a logical order
    - determine this order by thinking of workflows
    - each workflow will go different routes going from .tex to .pdf
    - these workflows will have roles (which need to be filled by listed technologies)
    - argue against inherently flawed workflows, which thus won't be tested
- test these workflows
    - how?
