Main To-Do-List for this thesis.
- introduce the reader into topic 
    - start with basic examples of the given problem
    - mention related/similar problems, but differentiate from the currently studied one ("differentiate" as in: to detect differences)
    - consider you peers: this part has to make clear wether the contents are relevant to their respective work or not
    - see: ![~/thesis/introduction](thesis/introduction/todo.md)
- think of the problems that could arise when dealing with your given problem, in this case: the translation of LaTeX-formatted documents 
    - start with easy to understand problems, similar to the ones in the introduction
    - work on more complicated ones, leading up to very niche ones (while making sure every example is unique)
    - sort/fit each kind of problem/example into a structure that makes sense in the table of contents
    - see: ![~/examples](examples/todo.md) and ![~/thesis/problems](thesis/problems/todo.md)
- determine the current technologies, which could tackle these problems
    - list these in a logical order
    - determine this order by thinking of workflows
    - each workflow will go different routes going from .tex to .pdf
    - argue against inherently flawed workflows, which thus won't be tested
    - see: ![~/thesis/technologies](thesis/technologies/todo.md)
- test these workflows
    - find a common ground in all those workflows (in this case: input remains the same)
    - what are the outputs?
    - are there any listed problems unsolved?
    - see: ![~/tests](tests/todo.md) and ![~/thesis/tests](thesis/tests/todo.md)
- solve unsolved problems or consider your own contribution
    - is there anything left unsolved?
    - are there problems that are theoretically unsolvable, but can be circumnavigated via a clever heuristic?
    - see: ![~/thesis/solution](thesis/contribution/todo.md)
- reflect on the work done
    - what similar/related work could enhance the current technology or has an entirely different approach to a different problem, that _could_ also work, when abstracting from the specific technology and thinking about the problems more generally (mathematically)
    - consider the ethics of any work replacing a human job (i.e. automating things)
    - conclude however you want. honestly at that point even a clever one-liner is fine.
    - clean-up git-repository (thesis is more important than the git you're working in)
    - see: ![~/thesis/conclusion](thesis/conclusion/todo.md)

Some reminders (needing constant review):
- tell apart (if possible) comments and to-do's
- comments do not belong in the work
- to-do's form the work, but the work itself should not reflect the to-do list, but rather the "sacred" document ("sacred" is not meant religiously, but rather operatively, as in: seperation of thoughts into pre-determined structure as a way of seperation of concerns)
