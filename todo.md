- finish tasks

### current projects

- project

### deadlines (with regards to those projects)
- thesis (2nd of december 2025)
- project (none, because: thesis)

### new ideas
- 1 (project): brief description
- 2 (thesis): this file
- 3 (project): brief description

#### Idea 1: more details
- if this gets to large, place in seperate file
- if file gets to large, place in folder and use more files
- if folder gets to large, divide and conquor -> seperation of concerns -> reduce redundancies -> new ideas
- continue further

#### Idea 2: more details
- life has lead me to a point, that required me to think about "how do i write a proper to-do-list"
- this is incomprehensible, even to myself
- could bring some structure into whatever i have been doing the past four-five months
- will probably talk with a prof about this
- five bullet points should be the limit, before reserving a new file i suppose

#### Idea 3: more details
- if this gets to large, place in seperate file
- continue further
- see idea 1

## Done; Never-Ending Protocol; nice-to-have, but not necessary
