### new ideas

- 2 (thesis): this file
- 3 (project): brief description

#### Idea 1: more details
- if this gets to large, place in seperate file
- continue further

#### Idea 2: more details
- life has lead me to a point, that required me to think about "how do i write a proper to-do-list"
- this is incomprehensible, even to myself
- could bring some structure into whatever i have been doing the past four-five months
- will probably talk with a prof about this
- five bullet points should be the limit, before reserving a new file i suppose

#### Idea 3: more details
- if this gets to large, place in seperate file
- continue further

## Done; Never-Ending Protocol; nice-to-have
- create a protocol template
- create an examplary to-do-list
