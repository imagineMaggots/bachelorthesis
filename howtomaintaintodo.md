- Re-evaluate "recent progress" daily
- Update: "To Do until the next meeting"
- Work on: "To Do list" in general, with regards to "summary of progress made so far" (or whatever i called it)
- Determine: Issues. Are there some issues that i just can't seem to resolve over a longer span of time?
- Add to "summary of progress over all" if possible!
