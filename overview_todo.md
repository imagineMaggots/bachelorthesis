- reflect on the work done
    - what similar/related work could enhance the current technology or has an entirely different approach to a different problem, that _could_ also work, when abstracting from the specific technology and thinking about the problems more generally (mathematically)
    - consider the ethics of any work replacing a human job (i.e. automating things)
    - conclude however you want. honestly at that point even a clever one-liner is fine.
    - clean-up git-repository (thesis is more important than the git you're working in)
    - see: [~/thesis/conclusion](thesis/conclusion/todo.md)

Some reminders (needing constant review):
- keep your comments to yourself!
- to-do lists do not contain space for notes!
- to-do lists can be developed into check-lists!
