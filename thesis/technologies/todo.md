Derived from "main" to-do list.
- list these in a logical order
    - list every used technology, that isn't your own as soon as possible (at this point alphanumeric sorting makes sense)
    - group them into similar categories
    - describe those categories briefly
    - formulate criteria for technologies in order to fit in said category
    - quickly list all technologies that meet the criteria to fit into this category
- determine this order by thinking of workflows
    - assign "roles" in these workflows (which need to be filled by listed technologies)
    - consider each above listed technology for each role (but only list the ones that fit the role obviously)
- each workflow will go different routes going from .tex to .pdf
    - describe/depict those routes
- argue against inherently flawed workflows, which thus won't be tested
