Derived from "main" to-do list.
- start with basic examples of the given problem
    - edit first sentence (happens every time, do not worry)
    - get rid of unrealistic, over-specific ones
    - use the easiest to understand ones for anyone not familiar with TeX or LaTeX
- mention related/similar problems, but differentiate from the currently studied one ("differentiate" as in: to detect differences)
    - mention that there exist similar problems you're explicitly not covering
    - mention that your not dealing with translating .tex to .tex, nor .tex to something similar
    - mention that _especially_ translating .pdf to .pdf is not part of the problem (as this is very interesting on its own; maybe even for the prof... add some citations for people dealing with that recently... he'll probably be interested in stuff like that)
- consider you peers: this part has to make clear wether the contents are relevant to their respective work or not
    - should be made clear after the previous
